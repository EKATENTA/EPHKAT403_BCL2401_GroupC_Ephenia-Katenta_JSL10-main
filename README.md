# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

Overview of the Project
Welcome to the Escape Vanilla JS Challenge! This project is designed to improve our debugging skills and deepen our understanding of JavaScript.

What I Included:
This README outlines the project's goals, lists the challenges given to splve, and  areas for improvement.

Challenges:
Room 1: Event Handling
Correct the ID used in the event listener.
Ensure accurate use of element IDs when displaying results.
Room 2: JavaScript Concepts and React
Add the 'async' keyword where needed.
Fix the function call to find the intersection of jsConcepts and reactConcepts.
Room 3: Asynchronous Operations
Handle asynchronous operations correctly, especially in the navigateLabyrinth function.
Adjust the findMostRecentBook function to compare dates accurately.
Fix the findIntersection function to determine the intersection of two sets correctly.

Areas of Improvement:
Create opportunities to make our code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand as we progress through the challenges.

Overall Learning:
By completing this project, i have improved my debugging skills and gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts like asynchronous programming and data manipulation.
